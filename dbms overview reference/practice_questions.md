## Practice Questions

1. What is the main purpose of a DBMS?
The main purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to provide a convenient and efficient way to store, retrieve, 
and manage data while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency.

2. Give 3 examples of enterprise DBMS software and 3 examples of open-source DBMS software.

Enterprise DBMS software (commercial, usually paid):
Oracle Database

Microsoft SQL Server

IBM Db2

Open-source DBMS software

MySQL

PostgreSQL

SQLite


3. How does a DBMS help reduce data redundancy?

A DBMS helps reduce data redundancy by storing all data in a centralized database that is shared across departments or applications, 
instead of each department keeping separate copies.

4. Explain the difference between a row and a column in a database table.

A row represents a single, complete entry in the table.

A column represents a specific type of data for all entries in the table.

5. List two examples of how a hotel might use a DBMS in its daily operations.

Room Reservations and Bookings – Storing and managing guest details, check-in/check-out dates, 
and room availability so staff can quickly see which rooms are free or booked.

Billing and Payment Records – Keeping track of charges for rooms, meals, and services, 
then automatically generating invoices for guests at checkout.

6. Why is role-based access control important in a DBMS?

Role-based access control (RBAC) is important in a DBMS because it:

Protects sensitive data – Ensures only authorized users can view or change certain information (e.g., only the finance team can see payment details).

Prevents accidental or malicious changes – Users can only perform actions allowed by their role, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption.

For example, in a hotel DBMS, a receptionist might only access bokking information, while the general manager can view financial and staff records too.

## Discussion
- How would using a DBMS change operations for a small business compared to a manual file system?

Using a DBMS instead of a manual file system would change operations for a small business in several key ways:

Manual File System                                                                      	With DBMS

Data stored in paper files or seperate spreadsheets                                         Data stored in a single, centralized database.

Hard to search                                                                              Instant searching and filtering with queries.

High risk of duplication and inconsistency.                                                 Reduced redundancy through centralized storage and normalization.
